_**Technologies used:**_ `python` `pytorch` `pytorch-lightning` `opencv` `pillow` `CNN` `Transformers` `django` `vannila js` `docker`<br>
_**Results:**_
  - Collected and preprocessed data for training
  - Developed Model Architecture using Conv3D + modified EfficientNetV2 + Transformer Encoder + TCN using description in the article
  - Made experiments with EfficientNetV2 parameters, sizes and with different languages (russian and english)
  - Made experiments with classification of visemes (visual representation of phoneme).
  - Developed WEB App for demo using Django and Vanilla JS

  The current version of the project is a classification of spoken words. I am currently working on predicting individual visemes.
